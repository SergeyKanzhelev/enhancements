## Goals

Enable gRPC probe natively from Kubelet without requiring users to package a
gRPC healthcheck binary with their container.

- https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe
- https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md

## Non-Goals

Add gRPC support in other areas of K8s (e.g. Services).

## Proposal

Add the follow configuration to the `LivenessProbe`, `ReadinessProbe`
and `StartupProbe`. Example:

```yaml
    readinessProbe:
      grpc:                     #+
        port: 9090              #+
        service: my-service     #+
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
```

This will result in the use of gRPC (using HTTP/2 over TLS) to use the
standard healthcheck service (`Check` method) to determine the health of the
container. Using `Watch` method of the healthcheck service is not supported,
but may be considered in future iterations.
As spec'd, the `kubelet` probe will not allow use of client
certificates nor verify the certificate on the container.  We do not
support other protocols for the time being (unencrypted HTTP/2, QUIC).

The healthcheck request will be identified with the following gRPC
`User-Agent` metadata. This user agent will be statically defined (not
configurable by the user):

```
User-Agent: kube-probe/K8S_MAJOR_VER.K8S_MINOR_VER
```

Example:

```
User-Agent: kube-probe/1.23
```

### Risks and Mitigations

1. Adds more code to Kubelet and surface area to Pod.Spec. *Response*: we
   expect that this will be generally useful given broad gRPC adoption in the
   industry.

## Design Details

```go
// core/v1/types.go

type Handler struct {
  // ...
  TCPSocket *TCPSocketAction `json...`

  // GRPC specifies an action involving a TCP port. //+
  // +optional                                      //+
  GRPC *GRPCAction `json...`                        //+

  // ...
}

type GRPCAction struct {                                                         //+
  // Port number of the gRPC service. Number must be in the range 1 to 65535.    //+
  Port int32 `json:"port" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=port"`                      //+
                                                                                 //+
  // Service is the name of the service to place in the gRPC HealthCheckRequest  //+
  // (see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md).      //+
  //                                                                             //+
  // The service name can be the empty string (i.e. "").                         //+
  Service string `json:"service" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=service"`            //+
                                                                                 //+
  // Host is the host name to connect to, defaults to the Pod's IP.              //+
  Host string `json,omitempty", protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=host"`                //+
}                                                                                //+
```

Note that `GRPCAction.Port` is an int32, which is inconsistent with
the other existing probe definitions. This is on purpose -- we want to
move users away from using the (portNum, portName) union type.

### Test Plan

- Unit test: Add unit tests to `pkg/kubelet/prober/...`
- e2e: Add test case and conformance test to `e2e/common/node/container_probe.go`.

### Alternative Considerations

Note that `readinessProbe.grpc.service` may be confusing, some
alternatives considered:

- `serviceName`
- `healthCheckServiceName`
- `grpcService`
- `grpcServiceName`

There were no feedback on the selected name being confusing in the context of a probe definition.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Implement the feature.
- Add unit and e2e tests for the feature.

#### Beta

- Solicit feedback from the Alpha.
- Ensure tests are stable and passing.

Depending on skew strategy:

- kubelet version skew ensures all (kubelet ver, cluster ver) support
  the feature.

#### GA

- Address feedback from beta usage
- Validate that API is appropriate for users. There are some potential tunables:
  - `User-Agent`
  - connect timeout
  - protocol (HTTP, QUIC)
- Close on any remaining open issues & bugs
- Promote tests to conformance

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Upgrade: N/A

Downgrade: gRPC probes will not be supported in a downgrade from Alpha.

### Version Skew Strategy

- We may not be able to graduate this widely until all kubelet version
  skew supports the probe type.


## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

Feature enablement will be guarded by a feature gate flag.

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: `GRPCContainerProbe`
  - Components depending on the feature gate: `kubelet` (probing), API
    server (API changes).

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. This would require restarting kubelet, and so probes for existing
Pods would no longer run.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

It becomes enabled again after the `kubelet` restart.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Yes, unit tests for the feature when enabled and disabled will be
implemented in both kubelet and api server.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

We passed the version skew problem for the new API. No planning is required.

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

We passed the version skew problem - the API will be available on any supported
version skew. So no issues are expected with rollout and rollback.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Rollback wouldn't address issues. Pods will need to stop using the new probe
type.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

N/A

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

When gRPC probe is configured, Pod must be scheduled and, the metric
`probe_total` can be observed to see the result of probe execution.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

When gRPC probe is configured, Pod must be scheduled and, the metric
`probe_total` can be observed to see the result of probe execution.

Event will be emitted for the failed probe and logs available in `kubelet.log`
to troubleshoot the failing probes.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

Probe must succeed whenever service has returned the correct response
in defined timeout, and fail otherwise.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

The metric `probe_total` can be used to check for the probe result. Event and
`kubelet.log` log entries can be observed to troubleshoot issues.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

Creation of a probe duration metric is tracked in this issue:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101035 and out of scope for this
KEP.

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

Adds < 200 bytes to Pod.Spec, which is consistent with other probe types.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

The overhead of executing probes is consistent with other probe types.

We expect decrease of disk, RAM, and CPU use for many scenarios where the https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe
was used to probe gRPC endpoints.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

No dependency on etcd availability.

###### What are other known failure modes?

None

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

- Make sure feature gate is set
- Make sure configuration is correct and gRPC service is reacheable by kubelet.
  This may be different when migrating off https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe
  and is covered in feature documentation.
- `kubelet.log` log must be analyzed to understand why there is a mismatch of
  service response and status reported by probe.
